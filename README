=== Official Ruby RPS Library ===

So, I decided to build a Ruby library to facilitate Rock, Scissors, Paper tournaments
between Ruby bots.

The API for building your own bot is extremely simple.

Look at Randomizer and Stubborn for what you need to implement. Its as simple as including
RPS::Bot and then implementing a #next method. History of rounds is available through #history.

The code is ugly, but whatever. It runs. I built this in an hour.

If you want to enter your own bot in the competition, then simply fork the repo, and do a pull request.
